# Usage

## Nab Individual Wallpapers

Long press / right click > save link. Just don't save the thumbnail by mistake!

## Shallow Clone

I recommend making a shallow clone of this repo as git keeps a history of all images. A shallow [update script](update.sh) is included for ease of use and scheduling.

```shell
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/buckmanc/wallpapers
```
# Attribution

I've added attribution where I can. Feel free to contact me or submit a pull request to add missing attribution.

# Aesthetic Decisions

Homescreen / desktop wallpapers underly icons, windows, and active tasks (read: chaos), so they should be spacious and calming. Lock screens are cleaner and less chaotic, providing an opportunity for more stand-out designs.
