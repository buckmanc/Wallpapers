# Usage

## Nab Individual Wallpapers

Long press / right click > save link. Just don't save the thumbnail by mistake!

## Shallow Clone

If using Git, I recommend making a shallow clone of this repo to pull only the current images and not the full history. A shallow [update script](update.sh) is included for ease of use and scheduling.

```shell
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/buckmanc/wallpapers
```

# Attribution

I've added attribution where I can. Feel free to contact me or submit a pull request to add missing attribution.

# Aesthetic Decisions

- **Desktop/homescreen: chill**
- **Lockscreen: exciting**
- **Terminal: elegant and subdued**
