# Wallpapers

A simple repo to house my wallpapers for ease of use and automation.

# Usage

It is recommended to make a shallow clone of this repo as git keeps a history of all images. A shallow update script is included for ease of use and scheduling.


```shell
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/buckmanc/wallpapers
```
